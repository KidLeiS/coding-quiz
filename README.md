## About The Project
Welcome to my coding quiz app. Please have fun playing around with the coding quiz (hopefully it shouldn't be too hard!)

I am currently learning Web APIs with eDX's front end coding bootcamp, this is a showcase of the use of web APIs to interact with the website and do some simple memory manipulation.

## Built With
-Javascript
-HTML & CSS (starter code provided by eDX)

## Getting Started
No installation required, please go ahead and use it!

You can access the application at the following [link](https://kidleis.github.io/coding-quiz/)

## Usage

The website should look something like this upon initialisation:

After clicking the "Start Quiz" button, it should begin a 60 seconds timer. Be careful, if you answer a question incorrectly, there will be a 10 second penalty!

After finishing the quiz, you will see your final score and the opportunity to save your score along with your initials.

The "submit" button will then take you to the highscores page (which you can also access via the "View Highscores" hyperlink on the top left). You can then view or clear your local highscores.
